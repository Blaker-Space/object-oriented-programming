//1.
int x = 5;
int y = 12;
int width = y + x / 4;
What is the result?

*13

//2. Two out of the following eight:
Explain differences between compiled, interpreted languages, and Java
Compiled language: whole document is compiled into machine language and the entire document
is ran at once.
Interpreted language: Each line is interpreted and then executed individually.
Java: Compiled into Bytecode, which is interpreted and executed for that machine at runtime.


Explain the three types of errors that may be found in code. Include causes and how/when
errors are found.
*Syntax error/compiler error: "Broke the rules of Java" leaving out a semicolon. Found at compile time
*Runtime error: Some sort of input that is invalid (expecting an integer, receive  a string). Divide by 0.
Reading outside of the bounds of an array.
*Logic error: The results produced are incorrect (i.e. an "if" statement that uses < instead of >).


What is pseudocode and when/how should it be used in the software development process?
Fake code/approximation for code. Used when creating an outline for your code.


What is the JVM? How does it work?
Stands for Java Virtual Machine. It interprets the bytecode that has been compiled


What are the characteristics of a high-level language?
Looks like human language and algebra instead of machine language. High-level languages are machine-independent


What are the four different ways that the flow of control can progress through a program?
Sequence: Do this until I reach a ;, then do the next until ;, etc.
Selection: Choose between one branch and another branch (used with if, else, and switch statements)
Repetition: Repeat a series of commands while a certain condition is true.
Functions/Methods: When a function call occurs, it skips down, performs the function, and then comes back


//3. Two out of the following four:

How does an object encapsulate data? (protect from outside world)
By making fields private so nobody can access them, but using public getters and setters to access and set the data.


What is the purpose of mutator methods? How should mutator methods be named?
To set private fields. 
They are named by using the word "set" and then the field it is setting (i.e. setNumberOfHuskies)
Takes the same datatype as the variable it is setting

What is the purpose of constructors? What are the naming rules for constructors?
To create a new object, and put it in a valid state. Must be named the exact same way as the class.


What is the purpose of accessor methods? How should accessor methods be named?
To read private data from fields. It should be named using "get" and then the field you are reading (i.e. getNumberOfHuskies)


//6. Create the two mutator methods:
public class Theater
{
private int attendance;
private String roomNumber;

//overloaded constructor

//accessors (get methods)

//mutators (set methods)
public void setAttendance(int attendance){
	if(attendance < 15 || attendance > 150)
		this.attendance = 20;
	else
		this.attendance = attendance;
}

public void setRoomNumber(String roomNumber){
	this.roomNumber = roomNumber;
}
//other methods
}
